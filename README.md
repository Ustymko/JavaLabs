# JavaLabs

**Topic for all labs in this repository:**

Musical shop. Implement hierarchy of musical instruments in music shop. Implement the search of instruments by type (wind, percussion, etc). Implement the serach of instruments for some music band (guitar, drums, etc). Implement the possibility of sorting found instruments by 2 different parameters (on choice), implemented as 2 separate methods. Sorting implementation must include sorting in classic and reversed order.

**Lab 2**
Implement class hierarchy (without any sorting or using data structures).
Make objects of created classes in main method of class Main.java.

**Lab 3**
Create class - Manager, which will include particular logic: f.e. sorting instruments by price and by weight.
For sorting embedded ways of sorting in Java must be used.
Sorting must be implemented in separate method.
Code can use Enum type if needed.

**Lab 4**
Transform project with code of 2'nd-3'rd labs to be able to perform it with maven.
To perform the project, run "mvn clean package"
You can generate pom.xml using maven command prompt run:
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=ua.lviv.iot -DartifactId=work -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.0 -DinteractiveMode=false
